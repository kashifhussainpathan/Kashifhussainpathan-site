        <p class="blog-content"> <b>Software Testing </b> Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying
            that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include
            preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.
        </p>
        <p>There are many different types of software tests, each with specific objectives and strategies:</p>
        <div>
            <h3>1.Automated unit testing</h3>
            <hr>
            <p> <b>Automated unit testing </b> is a method of testing software. Units (small sections) of the code are
                rigorously checked to ensure they work correctly. A separate program can be written specifically to test
                the unit, using every reasonable piece of data the code might encounter in real-world use. The goal of
                automated unit testing is to demonstrate that each part of a larger software development project works
                as intended. <br> <br>

                Automated unit tests may also aid in documenting the software's functionality. Developers who didn't
                write the code, but want to understand how it works, can view a unit test results to understand how the
                code interfaces with the system. Developers may also see how the code interacts with the end users who
                provide it with input and other units of the same software package.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>2.Integration testing</h3>
            <hr>
            <p> <b>Integration testing </b> also known as integration and testing (I&T) -- is a type of software testing
                in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined
                entity. However, these modules may be coded by different programmers. <br> <br>

                The aim of integration testing is to test the interfaces between the modules and expose any defects that
                may arise when these components are integrated and need to interact with each other.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>3.End-to-End Testing</h3>
            <hr>
            <p> <b>End-to-End Testing </b> is a technique that tests the entire software product from beginning to end
                to ensure the application flow behaves as expected. It defines the product's system dependencies and
                ensures all integrated pieces work together as expected.<br> <br>

                The main purpose of End-to-end (E2E) testing is to test from the end userâ€™s experience by simulating the
                real user scenario and validating the system under test and its components for integration and data
                integrity.
                <br> <br>
                Software systems nowadays are complex and interconnected with numerous subsystems. If any of the
                subsystems fails, the whole software system could crash. This is a major risk and can be avoided by
                end-to-end testing.
