    <p class="blog-content">Goa is one of the smallest states in India and a thriving tourist destination for both
      domestic and foreign tourist alike. Although it is a small state, it packs around 130 kms of coast line with large
      stretch of (mostly pristine and clean) beaches. The state of Goa is dived into two districts North Goa and South
      Goa. Both these regions attract their fare share of tourists. Mostly tourists prefer North Goa as it offers more
      choices and activities in terms of hotels, restaurants and night life. South Goa attracts tourists who are mostly
      looking for a relaxed vacation. You will either see a lot of beach huts in Goa for low end tourists or five star
      properties for high end tourists enjoying a luxury vacation. I have paid visits to Goa repeatedly over the last
      few years and I have mostly stayed at North Goa. It is an ideal place for a first time tourist because it offers a
      lot options of indulging either in hard festivities or chilling out in a secluded beach. Yes, North Goa features
      has its fair share of secluded beaches also where you will hardly see any crowd. One can spend a whole day on a
      beach bed in a secluded beach shack while having a glass of chilled bear in front of the waves. On the other hand
      if one wants an active holiday then there is plenty to see and do. I will be outlining some of the things ahead
      that the readers can enjoy whenever they visit Goa. 1.) Geography, Beaches of Goa: As mentioned in my post
      earlier, Goa is divided into two areas i.e. North Goa and South Goa. There are eleven regions in North Goa that
      predominantly constitute the bulk of the tourist area. It starts from Keri Beach right at the top (bordering
      Maharashtra) to Sinquerim Beach at the bottom. Following is the list of beaches/ regions given in ascending order:
      Calangute Beach in Goa tourist places Keri Arambol Mandrem Ashwem Morjim Vagator Anjuna Baga Calangute Candolim
      Sinquerim Calangute and Baga beaches are quite popular amongst Indian tourists. Out of these two beaches, Baga is
      the most commercial beach and is highly crowded especially near Brittos’ area. You will see a lot of tourists
      indulging in water sports over there. Calangute beach too can get crowded at certain areas but if one walks
      towards Candolim beach the crowds start thinning out and you will get stretches where you can be away from noisy
      tourists. Candolim beach bordering Calangute is again quite popular with both domestic and foreign tourists
      although it is not as commercialized as Baga and Calangute. Sinquerim beach after Candolim is not really a tourist
      beach. You will mostly see fishermen hauling their days’ catch or locals indulging in other commercial activities.
      This place is popular for dolphin spotting in the wee hours of the morning. You can book a dolphin spotting tour
      with any water sports operator in Goa. If one feels adventurous, he/ she can walk down the entire stretch from
      Baga to Candolim beach in about 1.5 to 2 hours. I have walked down from the beginning of Baga till the end of
      Calangute beach early evening. I wanted to enjoy the sunset (and also shake off the heavy afternoon beer out of my
      system). While venturing into the sea, one needs to watch out for the waves in Candolim, Calangute and Baga
      beaches. They can get surprisingly strong especially during the evening. You also need to watch out for the
      undercurrents once the waves recede. These are not the beaches to get adventurous especially if you are travelling
      with kids. There a lot of lifeguards on these beaches. Pay attention to their calls and whistles when they tell
      you to be careful around certain areas in the sea. Anjuna and Vagator are both rocky beaches. It isn’t very safe
      to swim in the sea around these beaches. There are a lot of rocks on the sea bed and chances of getting hurt are
      high. The waves around Anjuna beach too are very strong. Morjim, Ashwem and Mandrem are the best beaches to visit
      in the North. They are not overly crowded and are very clean. A certain area of Morjim beach is also a turtle
      nesting site. The waves in all the three beaches are gentle and serene and unless you venture very deep into the
      sea bed, these waves hardly bother you at all. These beaches are the best for kids/ toddlers as they offer an
      unending playground to them on the sand. There are a fair number of beach shacks over here but none of them are
      overcrowded. Arambol Beach is a hipster’s paradise. It’s a good place to explore for the slightly discerning
      tourist. This place is full of hippies and you will also see them involved in some commercial activities. It’s
      worthwhile to stay in Arambol for a night to witness a full moon party organized by the hippies. They start at
      sunset and carry on throughout the full moon night. This place is not really a family destination though. Keri
      Beach is the last beach in North Goa as it borders Maharashtra. This is a desolate beach and you won’t find a
      single shack over there. However, it’s worth visiting once for its scenic beauty, crystal clear sea water and
      pristine white sand. 2.) Climate and Accommodation: As Goa is located next to the Arabian Sea it experiences hot
      weather conditions throughout the year. During summers, the temperature soars to 35°C with extremely high
      humidity. The monsoon period is between June and September. This is the worst time to visit Goa since the beaches
      are off limits (due to high waves) and all the shacks are closed. Winter period is between December to February
      where the day’s temperature hovers around 25°C. The evenings are pleasant and the nights are cooler. This is the
      best time to visit Goa. I prefer to visit Goa after the first week of January. By that time the peak tourist
      season is over and the hotels become affordable. I have always chosen Calangute and Baga as the points to stay.
      This is the circuit where all the major bars and restaurants are located at a stretch. These places also offer a
      central base from where all the other areas in North Goa can be explored. Even the choices of hotels are good
      ranging from budget friendly to luxury accommodations. Given below are lists of hotels/ vacation rentals where I
      have stayed in throughout the years whenever I have visited Goa. I had a good experience with all these places and
      can safely recommend them to my fellow travelers.</p>
